    <h3>Tinolang Manok</h3>
        <p>
            Tinola is a traditional Filipino comfort food that usually consists of broth, chicken, leafy greens, papaya, and ginger. <br>
            This version features chayote squash and bok choy for a fresh, vibrant spin on traditional chicken soup. <br>
            Fish sauce is a key ingredient that lends a deliciously pungent taste. Chicken tinola is often served with rice to make a hearty meal.
