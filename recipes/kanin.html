    <h3>Fried Rice</h3>
        <p>
            This super-delicious rice can be made mostly ahead of time. You need the steamed rice to cool and dry out a bit before you fry it anyway. <br>
            The final result is addictive and goes with everything on this menu, so I like to make 2 batches--one plain and one with the optional <br>
            turmeric--which adds a little extra flavor and a pretty orange color.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups uncooked jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>½ (15 ounce) can unsweetened coconut cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put rice in a large bowl with enough water to cover by a few inches. Swirl with your fingers, <br> 
            then drain. Repeat until the water runs clear, about 3 times.
        </li>
        <li>Stir together rice, 1 1/2 cups water, coconut cream, turmeric, and salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil; <br>
             reduce heat and simmer, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Chill, <br>
              uncovered, 2 to 4 hours or overnight.
        </li>
        <li>Heat coconut oil in a 12-inch skillet or wok over high heat. Add garlic; cook until it just begins to brown, about 1 minute. <br>
             Add rice and spread in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, until lightly browned and crisp on the bottom, about 4 minutes. <br>
             Add fish sauce. Cook, stirring, until fully combined and heated through, about 2 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
